# HatGames-API

This is the source-code for my server which hosts the data for my partner and I's 'Hat Games'. These are games and funny little things we can do together, hopefully growing forever.

The idea is that whenever either one of us scans the NFC tag it will ping this server, and depending on it's current settings it will take action accordingly. The project may evolve over time too, which would be nice
